His purposes when glanced at can seem to be meaningless or even wrong to some people, but the more I study the Word of God and hear His Word being preached on certain topics, the more I can not deny how His ways are so loving and good. That our God even delighted in the creation of these things and how He does such things not just for the sake of because he can, but with intent and purpose that His glory be shown to the ends of the earth and beyond.</description></item><item><title>God's love</title><link>https://knowingyou.github.io/posts/godslove/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://knowingyou.github.io/posts/godslove/</guid><description>The love of God is a concept that everyone can get behind but very often we understand far too little of the implications behind what that looks like. We sing songs like “Jesus loves me yes I know, for the Bible tells me so” and carry on with life thinking we have this radiant beam that is on us which will grant us happy days. As someone who has grown up hearing about God’s love for us, it is easy to remember the greatest act of love God displayed for us on the cross and to be so humbled and drawn to tears by it.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Moving Back Home</title><link>https://knowingyou.github.io/posts/movinghomethoughts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://knowingyou.github.io/posts/movinghomethoughts/</guid><description>I’ve been asked a good amount of times what my plans are post grad: if I would stay down in Irvine or if I would go back home to San Francisco. Job opportunities and potential careers are always in the far back of my mind, so I give everyone the generic answer of going into research or starting a PHD program, usually something along those lines. Sure, I’m fine with doing it but if something else comes up, I’m completely open to taking it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://knowingyou.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://knowingyou.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
